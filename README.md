# NCP
Neural Conditional Probability (NCP) is an operator-theoretic approach for probability modeling that comes with strong theoretical guarantees under minimal assumptions.

Several applications are available in the [`examples` folder](https://github.com/alekfrohlich/NCP/tree/main/NCP/examples), including [uncertainty quantification](https://github.com/alekfrohlich/NCP/blob/main/NCP/examples/CP_student_performance.py), [conditional density estimation](https://github.com/alekfrohlich/NCP/blob/main/NCP/examples/NCP_benchmarks.ipynb), and mutual information estimation.

## Installation

Install the package locally with 

```bash
pip install -e .
```
